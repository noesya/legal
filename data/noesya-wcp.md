The purpose of this policy is to secure and protect the information assets owned by Noesya. Noesya provides computer devices, networks, and other electronic information systems to meet missions, goals, and initiatives. Noesya grants access to these resources as a privilege and must manage them responsibly to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information assets.

This policy applies to all wireless infrastructure devices that connect to a Noesya network or reside on a Noesya site that provide wireless connectivity to endpoint devices including, but not limited to, laptops, desktops, cellular phones, and tablets. This includes any form of wireless communication device capable of transmitting packet data.
